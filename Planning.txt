What Needs to be in the website:

1. Alittle about myselfS.
	I consider myself a coding enthusiast who is versatile in full-stack web developer. The time I spend outside of working on websites is used to keep up-to-date with new/currrent web design patterns and frameworks, researching new upcoming web techologies, and play around in some video games to relieve the stress of debugging. I am mostly a self taught programmer, I have been coding on computers since I was 14, but I also have some university education in languages like C/C++ and Java. Being a self taught programmer it is easy for me to teach myself a new framework over one weekend. I have experience working with the WAMP and LAMP stack, HTML, CSS, CSS Pre-Proccessing, CSS frameworks, JavaScript, Js Libraries, PHP, MySql, and much more which I will list below in my skills section.
